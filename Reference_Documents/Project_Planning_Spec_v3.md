## Updated Integration with Players Chart Logic

### Player Field Logic Alignment
The Players Chart module must enforce consistent and valid relationships between the following fields:
- `Player Type` (e.g., Individual, Organisation)
- `Player Role` (e.g., Provider, Recipient, Regulator)
- `Entity Nature` (e.g., Internal, External, Community)

Validation must ensure that the chosen combinations align with SPOiRMM principles and Tool responsibilities.

#### Business Rules
- If `Player Type` is "Organisation", then valid `Entity Natures` include "Internal" and "External".
- If `Player Type` is "Individual", then `Entity Nature` can be "Community" or "Internal".
- Certain `Player Roles` like "Regulator" or "Representative" must only be paired with "External" Entity Nature.
- The system must prevent invalid combinations using dropdown constraints or real-time validation prompts.

### Multi-Project Association
- A Player (individual or organisation) can be associated with **multiple projects** within the same organisation.
- Player records must be centrally stored at the organisation level and referenced per project.
- UI should allow selecting existing players or creating a new player scoped to the organisation.

### Impact on Planning Workflow
- Planning tools must reference shared player data at the organisation level.
- Changes to Players at the organisational level should cascade or notify linked projects.

### Organisation Workflow and Page
A new **Organisation Management Page** must be available from the Welcome Page. It will manage:
- Players (master list)
- Departments
- Organisation-wide risks and agreements

This page must be visually distinct from project pages (recommend using **Cadet Blue** or similar for icons and headers).

---

## Business Rules
- `Approval Date` is auto-populated when `Plan Approved?` is set to "Yes".
- Project status must be "Closed" before final assessment is signed off.
- Only Risk Plan Sponsor can approve the plan.

## Integration
- Links to:
  - **Players Chart**: Stakeholder overview
  - **Issues List**: Issue tracking
  - **Risk Register**: Formal risk documentation

## Security & Compliance
- Role-based access:
  - Only Sponsors can approve.
  - Only Coordinators can modify active plans.
- Compliance aligned with ISO 31000 & 9001.
- Audit trails for all actions.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Workflow automation (e.g., task reminders)
- Integration with external reporting tools
- Multi-language support

---

## UI Color Scheme

The Project Planning tab should follow the SPOiRMM visual conventions used in diagrams and tools:

### Color Assignments (Based on SPOiRMM Players and Tools)
| Role / Function            | Color      | Usage Context                      |
|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Recipient of Benefit      | Blue       | Text, background, icons            |
| Provider of Benefit       | Red        | Text, borders, active UI elements  |
| Benefit Enablers (Staff)  | Green      | Icons, labels, highlights          |
| Regulators & Representatives | Yellow | Informational banners, tooltips    |
| Community (background)    | Grey (outline) | Background outlines               |
| Jurisdiction Tool         | Purple     | Section indicators or tab headers |
| Market Tool               | Orange     | Section indicators or tab headers |
| Enterprise Tool           | Teal       | UI containers for external roles  |
| Organisation Tool         | Light Blue | Internal structure containers      |
| Agreements Tool           | Dark Blue  | Matrix headers, agreement status   |
| Resources Tool            | Brown      | Timeline and process indicators    |

### Design Notes
- Use soft, complementary shades to avoid harsh contrasts.
- Maintain consistency across modules.
- Color-coded icons or badges should be used to distinguish Player roles and Tool contexts.
- All colors must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for contrast.

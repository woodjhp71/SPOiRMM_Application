# Firebase Implementation Plan - Staged Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines a staged implementation approach for the Firebase Data Model Design, following a bite-sized chunk deployment strategy. Each stage builds upon the previous one, with testing and validation before proceeding to the next stage.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach
- **Incremental Development**: Build data model piece by piece
- **Test-Driven**: Validate each stage before proceeding
- **Integration-First**: Integrate with app at each stage
- **Rollback Ready**: Each stage can be rolled back if issues arise
- **Environment-First**: Secure environment setup before development

### Current Status
- **Firebase Project**: ✅ Created (spoirmm)
- **Environment Variables**: ✅ Configured and secured
- **Vercel Deployment**: ✅ Documented and ready
- **Firebase CLI**: ✅ Installed (v14.11.2)
- **Security Configuration**: ✅ Implemented
- **Primary Admin User**: ✅ spoirmmitc2@gmail.com configured in Firebase Auth
- **Firebase Configuration**: ✅ Initialized in project
- **Security Rules**: ✅ Created and tested
- **Admin User Setup**: ✅ Created in users collection with full permissions
- **Authentication Integration**: ✅ Firebase Auth UID matches Firestore document ID

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass for current stage
- App integration working without breaking changes
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security rules properly enforced
